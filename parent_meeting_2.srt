00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,680
 All right, so we're gonna have a Q and A.

157
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,920
 Before we start the Q and A,

158
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,560
 we have our medical lead here.

159
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,800
 This is the first one that spoke Australia.

160
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,440
 And I'm gonna have her talk a little bit

161
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,600
 about the medical form so that you can feel it out

162
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,800
 and what she and her medical team

163
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,360
 would really need to know from you,

164
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,240
 especially if you're going to camp out.

165
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,480
 So while I hand you a mic,

166
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,120
 Travis and me using the second mic, B1.

167
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:30,240
 Everyone, I think Travis up there,

168
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,240
 and also, and these are information technology/AB staff members.

169
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:52,840
 This is, I bet you missed her one.

170
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,840
 Okay, just real quick,

171
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,000
 I know a lot of you guys have already

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,080
 developed out the medical concept.

173
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,080
 Just a quick bug in the ear.

174
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,360
 If your child has an allergy

175
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,400
 or even like childhood, younger,

176
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,640
 asthma or something like that,

177
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,560
 if you didn't put it out there,

178
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,240
 just give us a heads up of saying,

179
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,520
 "Hey, I need an update."

180
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,120
 Some of you guys would may call

181
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,720
 'cause I just noticed somebody had a meth allergy

182
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,120
 and I didn't know how severe they had an EpiPen.

183
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,560
 It's not much of an issue

184
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,280
 we have the medians here.

185
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,680
 It's more of an issue when we go out on the camp outs,

186
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,880
 'cause we've had it happen before.

187
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,360
 Somebody had an asthma attack in years,

188
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,120
 and of course, because of all the dust,

189
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,640
 they have a lot of water there

190
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,520
 and they didn't have an inhaler.

191
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,960
 Same thing, we should prefer these food allergies.

192
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,560
 Most of the time our kids know

193
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,160
 they should avoid those things,

194
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,880
 but if it happens and we don't have an EpiPen

195
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,560
 or what have you, then it could be from an issue.

196
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,600
 So just something to keep in mind,

197
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,720
 and if you guys have any questions,

198
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,600
 again, my name is Rea.

199
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,640
 If you wanna get in touch with me,

200
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,480
 just let me go.

201
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,080
 And while I'm here and if you guys are medical

202
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,920
 and wanna help out while we're on our camping trips,

203
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,280
 that would be spectacular.

204
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,720
 So we have a medical team

205
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,880
 and they take turns being the one on duty,

206
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,560
 and we normally have a tent that's just for medical.

207
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,240
 So she's asking if any of you are medical,

208
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,040
 if you wouldn't mind being part of that,

209
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,880
 for people that take some of that.

210
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,120
 - Dr. Nurse EMT.

211
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,000
 - Dr. Nurse EMT.

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,040
 - All right, great.

213
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,400
 I see a couple more faces,

214
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,720
 but I think maybe I should stop at this point

215
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,600
 and not run around.

216
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,840
 But all right, so now we're gonna open it for Q&A,

217
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,360
 and I think I can just use this one line.

218
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,160
 Any questions that you all have?

219
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,200
 Raise your hand and I'll come to you with a microphone

220
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,960
 and you can ask away.

221
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,840
 Is that a question back here?

222
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,120
 Did you raise your hand?

223
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
 Oh no, okay, I have it.

224
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,960
 Oh, that's your microphone there.

225
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,520
 How do you point to your wife to have a question?

226
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,880
 Okay, nice.

227
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,320
 You do have a question for me.

228
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,880
 - Um, well, if you were in your office.

229
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,720
 - Okay, so.

230
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,680
 - I don't know if you can ask me all the time.

231
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,520
 - Okay.

232
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,840
 - I'll be right back.

233
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,320
 - So I'd like to recap.

234
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
 All right, so quick question.

235
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,160
 How many of you were here last week?

236
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,600
 So there's quite a few.

237
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,440
 Okay, let's do this.

238
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,840
 How many of you did not hear last week's talk?

239
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:53,880
 (audience murmurs)

240
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,920
 It was mentioned last week something about

241
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,080
 then having a tense honor or a happy honor or something.

242
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,200
 So I'm going to use the pen words at the beginning

243
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,640
 of this next month.

244
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,720
 And I was confused about whether it was a good night

245
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,320
 and then somebody mentioned like,

246
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,320
 maybe some of the other forms attached to the act.

247
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,560
 So, good question.

248
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,880
 (audience murmurs)

249
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,720
 Okay.

250
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,680
 So the question is about, she has a friend,

251
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
 and the question is about the friend's interest

252
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,920
 in camping, my colleagues, what you're asking.

253
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,040
 So, let me get one of the papers here.

254
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,000
 One second.

255
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,040
 I'm just gonna get the calendar.

256
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,600
 I should have the dates all memorized,

257
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,360
 but in case I'm wrong, I'm gonna have those.

258
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,400
 So we're having a social,

259
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,840
 and it's consisting of a club meeting.

260
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,680
 And the date is September 9, I believe,

261
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,120
 but I just wanna have it in my hand.

262
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,280
 - Yeah, that's correct.

263
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,520
 - It is, okay.

264
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,360
 So it is, it's September 9.

265
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,440
 So we're gonna have a club meeting at four.

266
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,640
 Club meeting is from four to 6.30.

267
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,480
 The kids will always come back in here

268
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,720
 as they finish club meeting,

269
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,560
 and we'll end the club meeting.

270
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,680
 Then we'll start the social.

271
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,360
 The social will start off with a small worship,

272
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,720
 a short worship, and then from there,

273
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,040
 we'll dismiss them back to the rooms for the social.

274
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,400
 So the friends, for the social part,

275
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,560
 will go straight out to the back.

276
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,440
 Do you know where the lower east center is?

277
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,560
 So the lower east center, there's some disposal

278
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,040
 or garbage dairies and some trailers,

279
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,240
 and then there's a big field.

280
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,800
 So I think if you just go straight back,

281
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,040
 you'll see the field.

282
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,480
 The friends will be camping overnight,

283
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,800
 and we're doing that as an intro to friends camping.

284
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,720
 Most of these kids have not camped,

285
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,100
 and we don't wanna take them away to a camp

286
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,560
 and have it their first experience.

287
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,360
 We want it to be here, where they're comfortable,

288
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,760
 where they need to go inside the building.

289
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,260
 In the past, we've had a child cry

290
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,880
 quietly just not used to being in a tent,

291
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,360
 and we were able to bring her into the lower east center.

292
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,640
 We're able to call the parent,

293
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,120
 because all of you live semi-linear body,

294
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,520
 and we've just found that's the easiest way

295
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,400
 to introduce them, how to put up their tents,

296
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,360
 how to get into their sleeping bags.

297
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,160
 Rolling up a sleeping bag is such a big deal to them.

298
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,120
 It's hard, and even parents have a hard time

299
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,480
 rolling them back up.

300
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,960
 It's okay, you don't have to roll them back

301
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,520
 and put them in the small bag that they came in.

302
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,960
 You just learn to roll it up, that type of thing.

303
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,600
 But that's what this thing is about.

304
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,700
 They are staying overnight, yes.

305
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,960
 Okay, no, no, no.

306
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:42,840
 So the question is what about volunteers?

307
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,640
 So yes, parents, if you would like to stay overnight

308
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,440
 with your child in the tent, you are more than welcome to.

309
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,880
 We just need to make sure that you've done

310
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,120
 what's called Stirling Volunteers,

311
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,200
 and that is a program online,

312
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,000
 it's about a 45 minute to an hour training,

313
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,300
 training on child safety, on how to take care of kids,

314
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,920
 and once you answer all the questions,

315
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,760
 then you'll pass, and then it'll ask you

316
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,120
 for a background check.

317
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,720
 It'll ask for your social security,

318
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,080
 or your, okay, and then they'll ask for something,

319
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,160
 and they'll do a background check on you,

320
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,000
 and then the conference will let us know,

321
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,960
 yes, this person is fine,

322
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,160
 and then you're able to stay overnight.

323
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,200
 So that's the process for parent health risk.

324
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,800
 We do need to have you Stirling Volunteer,

325
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,880
 and you can't wait the day before,

326
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,000
 because the conference still has to clear it.

327
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,040
 So no later than three or four days before,

328
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,880
 and that gives the conference time to clear the meeting.

329
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,600
 But yes, so in the past, it's normally,

330
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,960
 in the past we've had most of them,

331
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,240
 each of the kids have their family there with them.

332
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,880
 Sometimes it's a whole family,

333
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,840
 sometimes it's just one parent,

334
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,780
 but the kids can bring their own tents.

335
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,160
 This is friends, if they are comfortable

336
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,280
 in camping on their own in a little pup tent, that's fine.

337
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,220
 But again, this being the first time,

338
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,280
 I would suggest either come with them,

339
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,680
 or parents come to them,

340
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,360
 or you know, you stay during the day through the evening,

341
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,880
 and if they're okay, you know, you tuck them into bed,

342
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,280
 I'll come back in the morning, that's fine, also.

343
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,640
 But again, you know your child's comfort level,

344
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,840
 and especially these are new kids,

345
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,060
 they don't really know much about path liners.

346
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,920
 Again, we will try to teach them some camping skills,

347
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,680
 but it's mainly about getting comfortable

348
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,760
 sleeping in a tent overnight.

349
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,520
 If they want to tent with friends, that's fine,

350
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,560
 as long as all parents of those friends

351
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,640
 that want to camp together agree to it.

352
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,440
 So let's say three boys want to tent together,

353
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
 we need to get permission from those parents,

354
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,000
 all three boys, that yes,

355
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,880
 they can sleep together overnight.

356
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
 Or same thing with girls,

357
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,120
 of course it's girls with girls, boys with boys.

358
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,440
 And if it's a parent, it doesn't matter,

359
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,800
 it can be a daughter with a daughter,

360
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,280
 or a son with a mother, that's fine,

361
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,440
 but there cannot be other kids in your tent with you,

362
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,560
 it's just gotta be your child.

363
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,200
 And those are rules for the conference.

364
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,260
 So they'll be camping overnight,

365
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,520
 they'll have pizza for dinner,

366
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,760
 then they'll do activities, it's a social,

367
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,320
 so we want them to get to know each other,

368
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,840
 especially their classes.

369
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,520
 In the past we've been able to do a social

370
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,680
 with the whole club, it's just,

371
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,400
 you know, we're 215 right now,

372
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,760
 and it's kind of hard to get them to all things,

373
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,240
 but especially with their classes.

374
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,880
 I think the friends have 40, over 40,

375
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,800
 same thing with the family,

376
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,400
 each of our classes are getting 40 and above,

377
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,500
 that's enough people to socialize with and get to know.

378
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,880
 And some of the classes, in addition to the friends,

379
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,820
 it depends on the counselor,

380
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,840
 they have decided that they want to stay over

381
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,400
 and have a walk-in.

382
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,120
 So we used to do a walk-in for the whole club,

383
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,840
 and again, we're just too big to put everybody overnight here.

384
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,720
 So it really depends on the counselor,

385
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,400
 and the counselors will be letting you know

386
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,840
 and shoot in your group chat.

387
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,080
 Chat me, where is it now?

388
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,920
 Chat with me.

389
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,080
 Anyway, in your group chat, got it right, the third time,

390
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,960
 they'll be letting you know whether you'll be staying

391
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,720
 overnight or if you'll just be doing the social that evening

392
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,960
 and what time you think of your child.

393
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,120
 And again, this is optional,

394
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,800
 some kids are not, they're very shy

395
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,480
 when it comes to social,

396
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,920
 but this is really a good way for them to get to bond

397
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,720
 and get to know other kids.

398
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
 Camping and sleeping overnight,

399
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,040
 spending hours together playing games,

400
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,360
 best way to make friends.

401
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,280
 And I would highly suggest having your kid be a part of it

402
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,120
 because they'll really get a head start

403
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,720
 on having a body with other kids in their class.

404
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,960
 So once they stay overnight, in the morning,

405
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,320
 you know, we'll have them revelry,

406
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,160
 I don't know, we'll do the duh duh duh duh duh duh duh.

407
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,240
 But we'll wake them up and then we'll have breakfast

408
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,720
 or breakfast will be in the lower east center.

409
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,280
 It'll be a filling breakfast

410
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,040
 because then they're going to be doing a swimming water.

411
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,480
 And it's called basic water safety.

412
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,280
 We'll be walking them over in groups

413
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,280
 over to the Florida living pool that's over there.

414
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,400
 So we've got that reserved,

415
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,840
 I believe it's from 91, that's when we reserved it.

416
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,400
 So when we're bringing the kids over,

417
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,080
 we're not asking them to have major swimming skills.

418
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,880
 This is basic water safety.

419
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,240
 We just want to know that they can float on their back

420
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,680
 for 10 seconds or they can tread water,

421
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,320
 you know, for another 10 seconds,

422
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,520
 that they're comfortable with diving down into the pool

423
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,120
 and grabbing an object off the bottom of the floor

424
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,560
 of the pool, little simple things like that

425
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,840
 that they can do, yeah, just float on their back for a while.

426
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,200
 We just want to be able to know if they're in trouble,

427
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,480
 they can do these things because we've taught them

428
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,160
 until somebody arrives to help them.

429
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,920
 So that's all these skills are basic water safety.

430
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,960
 And again, we'll help them.

431
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,040
 I know in the past when I taught them,

432
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,320
 we've had some kids, they really can't float

433
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,920
 and it just boggles my mind,

434
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,200
 but there's some kids who hold them

435
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,600
 and then they just go poo all the way down.

436
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,440
 And when we kept trying this, hold your breath,

437
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,720
 hold your breath, I know this one boy,

438
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,680
 and he was all on muscle, he was older while on muscle.

439
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,560
 And I'm holding my breath, she's sure I can.

440
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,440
 Anyway, we did pass him,

441
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,560
 but at least we learned how to tread water

442
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,680
 and how to doggy paddle.

443
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,800
 Those are the types of skills

444
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,160
 that we're gonna try and teach them.

445
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,560
 So we want to tell the kids don't stress out

446
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,360
 if you don't pass one of the skills,

447
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,120
 we will work with you on that.

448
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,440
 And again, they're simple skills.

449
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,920
 They're not swimming across the swimming pool and back,

450
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,480
 that's beginners, sort of.

451
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,120
 We're just doing basic water safety.

452
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,920
 So basic water safety,

453
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,320
 and I believe they will be doing either a class requirement

454
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,800
 when you're not doing swimming or an honor,

455
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,280
 and we'll just keep rotating the kids that way.

456
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,800
 And as we get a little closer,

457
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,240
 it'll all be in the groupie chat

458
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,600
 as to what time you can pick up your child,

459
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,680
 and yes, we'll have probably a little snack for them,

460
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,040
 'cause we'll assist them around lunchtime,

461
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,080
 but that's the plan for the weekend, in a nutshell.

462
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,480
 Does everyone have any questions

463
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,760
 on that weekend for the friends so far?

464
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,000
 It's a fun weekend.

465
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
 It's a fun weekend for the kids.

466
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,840
 The staff are on a jury eye in the morning,

467
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,200
 but not as bad when it's during the tense,

468
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,320
 'cause they tend to fall asleep.

469
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,000
 It's the ones that are in the walk-in overnight.

470
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,800
 Those kids don't sleep, but it's a walk-in,

471
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,080
 and we enjoy the time with the kids.

472
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,920
 Like I knew the guide class, they are gonna do a walk-in,

473
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,800
 and I believe they will be in the youth center.

474
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,200
 Boys are gonna be downstairs, girls will be upstairs.

475
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,960
 So they're gonna play games 'til around midnight,

476
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,080
 and they may change this, so don't take this as solid.

477
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,640
 This is really what's gonna happen.

478
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,600
 And then after midnight, they're gonna do

479
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,880
 a little agape feast, or maybe around 11, 30.

480
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,160
 Some cheese, some breads, some crackers,

481
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,000
 and they're just gonna worship together at midnight,

482
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,800
 and they can go to sleep after that.

483
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,480
 So different activities for the kids.

484
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,600
 And I see some smiling, I don't know,

485
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,480
 are they gonna be awake?

486
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,280
 Oh yes, they're awake.

487
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,320
 These kids stay awake.

488
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,680
 Even the young ones that normally go to sleep early,

489
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,320
 they are just crying away.

490
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,180
 They're so excited about these activities.

491
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,200
 So again, we'll let you know which classes

492
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,040
 will stay awake, and which ones will just do a social

493
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,960
 until 11 or 12 at night.

494
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,400
 Thank you, that's a good question.

495
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,200
 All right, any other questions?

496
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,040
 Yes.

497
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:21,760
 - Well, my question is for me,

498
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,200
 I think I'll count out this year, 15, actually.

499
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,080
 I was not able to be in the meeting last week.

500
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,200
 So, I think Dylan's like a summer in the morning.

501
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,960
 - Okay, he's finding a recap on Gillette.

502
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,760
 So Gillette is the international campery

503
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,900
 that happens every five years.

504
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,800
 It's like the Mecca, it's the heaven for pathfinders,

505
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,040
 it's as close to heaven as you can get,

506
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,440
 of course it's very far from heaven,

507
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,880
 but this is what all the bad guys wanna do.

508
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,640
 It's every five years, it's an international campery

509
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,020
 where clubs from all around the world meet,

510
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,560
 and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands

511
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,600
 of pathfinders are gathered together.

512
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,760
 This year is gonna be in Gillette, Wyoming.

513
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,600
 Normally, in the past many years,

514
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,880
 it's been in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

515
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,040
 We're moving to Wyoming, and we will figure out

516
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,720
 how to transport all the kids there.

517
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,880
 We are trying to get flights,

518
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,620
 and nothing's available at this point.

519
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,640
 I mentioned last week, we tried to charter a plane,

520
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,120
 and we were told we could charter the plane,

521
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,000
 but they were gonna charge us 1,297 per person.

522
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,800
 And we're like, nevermind, we don't need to charter a plane.

523
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,640
 We will just figure out how to get everybody out there.

524
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,160
 So what I told all the parents is,

525
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,680
 if you're planning to go out there on your own

526
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,680
 and do a little bit of a vacation ahead of time,

527
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,280
 then grab your own tickets if you'd like,

528
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,880
 or if you're gonna drive out there,

529
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,080
 let us know we don't need tickets, that type of thing.

530
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,880
 As we get closer, I believe by next month

531
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,720
 and the following month,

532
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,040
 we should be seeing some flights on there.

533
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,860
 Last year, we saw flights around that time

534
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,080
 being about $400 to $600, and that was last year,

535
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,560
 so we don't know what the flights are gonna be this year.

536
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,560
 We have budgeted for $750 per person,

537
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,160
 and we hope it's not gonna go too much higher than that.

538
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,480
 When we do the costs for each person to go,

539
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,480
 if there's no fundraising and no discounts or nothing,

540
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,040
 we figured it would cost about $14.50 per person to go.

541
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,040
 $14.50, now we are going to try and subsidize

542
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,080
 the pathfinders as much as we can.

543
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,720
 We're aiming, we think we could do $12.50

544
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,680
 for each of the pathfinders,

545
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,520
 but we're hoping to raise enough money

546
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,360
 to bring that down even further.

547
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,520
 So we used to say it was $800,

548
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,780
 well, that was two years ago, it's not $800 anymore,

549
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,400
 even just food costs have gone up a lot.

550
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,100
 Anything has gone up, everything has gone up.

551
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,100
 And so again, $12.50 to $14.50

552
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,120
 if there are no subsidies.

553
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,960
 We have a bunch of teams that are working together.

554
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,280
 We've got a fundraising team, we've got a financial team.

555
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,960
 We have different people that are working

556
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,920
 and trying to get donations from either businesses

557
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,600
 or people that want to give donations.

558
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,460
 If you know of anybody or anyone that would like to sponsor,

559
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,600
 even if it's sponsoring one child

560
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,480
 that can't do it on their own

561
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,780
 or if it's sponsoring a t-shirt,

562
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,080
 we like to wear the same t-shirt each day

563
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,880
 so we can see our kids.

564
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,820
 And it looks really sharp when you have everyone.

565
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,600
 We were able to do that last year.

566
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,860
 Each day we had a different colored shirt

567
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,280
 and had the logo on the front and different size

568
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,360
 and on the back is a forest lake pathfinders Florida.

569
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,920
 So anytime the kids are running off,

570
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,560
 you can see on the back, that's our kid,

571
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,200
 that's our kid, that's our kid, very helpful.

572
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
 So we're asking for sponsors for that.

573
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,960
 That would be about $4,000 to $4,500 for a sponsor.

574
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,520
 We put the sponsors logo on the back.

575
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,940
 So it's good advertising for them.

576
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,980
 Everybody around the world can see their logo.

577
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,600
 If they want to share the cost with another company,

578
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,240
 we can put two logos on there.

579
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,280
 A family has already sent those sponsors

580
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,620
 so if they want, we'll put their name on there.

581
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,640
 Last year, a family sponsor, they're like,

582
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,920
 "Yeah, I want to put her name just before

583
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,100
 "state pathfinders on the back."

584
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,800
 So again, if you know of anyone that's willing to sponsor,

585
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,560
 even if they would like to sponsor,

586
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,560
 we get a backpack or sling pack for each kid.

587
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,460
 And I should have brought copies of those.

588
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,340
 I mean, I should have brought samples of those.

589
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,360
 We give them a sling pack.

590
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,400
 So we give them what's called a spag

591
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,840
 and that includes the shirts.

592
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,280
 There's a sling pack.

593
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,760
 We try to include some kind of a water bottle

594
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,640
 or something to drink from that's forest lake pathfinders

595
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320
 that use the water cold.

596
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,640
 And we also try to somehow keep their lunches cold,

597
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,640
 their lunch pack or one of those cooler foldable bags.

598
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,680
 So some of the swag that we work out is that.

599
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,200
 We will also be doing pins.

600
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,720
 Pins are a big thing.

601
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,240
 And when they're, I mean, nothing about pins.

602
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,680
 I mean, I knew about pins, but I didn't know.

603
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,640
 I was like, "Oh my goodness, it's like a train crack."

604
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,560
 'Cause they would go to each other.

605
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
 You got pins, you got pins?

606
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,800
 And they would just keep training.

607
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,560
 Even my little inventor who didn't know anything,

608
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,720
 he was like the most person,

609
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,200
 one that was the most trainable with all their people.

610
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,680
 He didn't mind going up to adults and asking for a pin.

611
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,080
 And the cuter you are, the cooler you are,

612
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,920
 the more you get pins.

613
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,200
 So, you know, send your little ones out there

614
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,720
 and you can get pins for your older kids.

615
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,520
 But pins is something they do and they learn honors.

616
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,320
 They do a lot of activities there.

617
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,760
 I mentioned last week, I was with the teen boys

618
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,960
 and I went with them wherever they went.

619
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,280
 And we always went to some water thing.

620
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,240
 We went sailing, we did paddling, we did anything water

621
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,360
 is what we did every day.

622
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,520
 And it's tiring to keep up with a bunch of teen boys,

623
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,200
 but you know, you'll be going with your kid most likely.

624
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,640
 And whatever that kid decides to do,

625
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,880
 we'll put it into a group with other children.

626
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,800
 So those water sports are what they like.

627
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,240
 And it's usually for varsity.

628
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,880
 The water sports are usually just for varsity,

629
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,000
 just know that.

630
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,280
 But I know some of the younger kids wanted to go to the YMCA.

631
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,400
 Some of the younger kids, I believe,

632
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,960
 there's going to be horseback riding.

633
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,200
 So many different activities every day.

634
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,800
 You will not run out of them to peace.

635
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,840
 In fact, your kids will be like,

636
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,440
 "Oh, we're going to do them all."

637
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,960
 But they'll have to choose what activity they'd like to do.

638
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,800
 Yes.

639
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,120
 - Okay, I guess it's a final.

640
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,520
 So let's say that I get it.

641
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,360
 - Okay.

642
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,160
 - With my five.

643
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,000
 Let's say that I get it here.

644
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 How do I make it work to make it

645
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,120
 more weighty, by the way?

646
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,360
 I just want you to say,

647
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,560
 "I pay you an interest,

648
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,400
 "I pay you a different fee,

649
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,840
 "or I pay you a dollar,

650
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,640
 "can the parents work with me in the house

651
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,880
 "and go to safety?"

652
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,040
 And say, "Well, I don't want to participate."

653
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,440
 Or wait for the moment.

654
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,360
 How do you work with acting?

655
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,200
 Is that an option for a car?

656
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,800
 Are you allowed to work in the house?

657
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,200
 - Okay, so the question is about logistics.

658
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,640
 So it sounds like your family is not going to camp,

659
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
 but you're going to be there.

660
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,120
 Is that correct?

661
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,160
 And let's say that it is.

662
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
 Let's say that it is.

663
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,000
 - That's an option.

664
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,840
 - Okay.

665
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,400
 - We want to put it on our pay options.

666
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,320
 - Okay, yes, good.

667
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,140
 Good question.

668
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,980
 The options?

669
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,000
 The options are you can camp with the whole club

670
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,480
 as a family within a tent.

671
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,640
 Or some kids are being like,

672
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,240
 "No, Mom, I want to sleep with myself,

673
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,560
 "I want to sleep with my friends."

674
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,800
 All right, so there's a tent of friends,

675
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,360
 and then there's a family, a parent tent nearby.

676
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,760
 So that's the first option.

677
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,960
 You can be a part of the club 100% of the time.

678
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,720
 You're camping with us, you're eating with us,

679
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,840
 you're walking to all the different activities together,

680
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,840
 or keeping track of your kids as a camp, as a club.

681
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,040
 So that's the first option.

682
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,320
 That's the option that a lot of people will do.

683
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,780
 A second option is if you are wanting to find a hotel

684
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,420
 on your own and not camping.

685
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,260
 Yes, parents can do that.

686
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,480
 You can get a hotel.

687
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,560
 If your child is with you at the hotel,

688
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,420
 then they're not gonna be the responsibility of the club.

689
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,040
 They will be with you at the hotel.

690
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,840
 And the reason we're saying that is because

691
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,640
 it's so difficult to keep track of the kids.

692
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,320
 Okay, we're dropping the kid off with you.

693
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,840
 Okay, we're picking up the kid now.

694
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,440
 All right, we're dropping the kid off with you.

695
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,840
 We can't do that with 200 and some kids.

696
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,680
 So you're either with the club with your child,

697
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,420
 or the child is with you and not a part of the club.

698
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,120
 They're welcome to join in in what we're doing.

699
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,840
 And food-wise, if you're eating with us,

700
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,600
 which most people, I believe, will be eating with us,

701
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,400
 it's much cheaper than eating out.

702
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,880
 You can still come for the meals.

703
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,320
 So a lot of parents that went, that just don't camp,

704
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,200
 they would get a hotel room,

705
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,640
 they would come first thing in the morning, eat breakfast,

706
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,560
 and just be on site with their kids the whole day.

707
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,240
 So they would go with their kids.

708
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,520
 We're asking each parent whether they're camping with us

709
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,040
 or whether you're off-site to put in four hours every day.

710
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,560
 So four hours can be, you know,

711
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,000
 you can sign up to be one of the chaperones

712
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,080
 going to the different activities.

713
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,240
 We're gonna need some people to help with cooking,

714
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,640
 with cleaning, with camp duty, with, you know,

715
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,560
 if you're off-site, a lot of people who sign up

716
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,240
 for buying food and bringing it to the camp,

717
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,420
 transporting food items back and forth.

718
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,600
 And that's another option you can do.

719
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,560
 You can be on site and do that.

720
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,480
 But again, the children will either be camping with us

721
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,280
 or they'll be in your responsibility.

722
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,480
 They can come and join the club,

723
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,520
 but they're not our responsibility

724
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,460
 just because they're with you on your schedule.

725
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,880
 Okay, yes?

726
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,920
 - And financially what we do is just under the cost.

727
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,480
 If you're not paying for food versus who you are, okay?

728
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,800
 - You're asking about the cost.

729
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,840
 So yes, if you're transporting yourself,

730
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,520
 by yourself, transportation,

731
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,120
 we'll subtract transportation from there.

732
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,880
 Food, we always kept the food on

733
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,320
 because everybody did eat with us,

734
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,720
 but we can figure that out if we need to.

735
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,760
 If you don't want to eat with the club at all,

736
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,920
 I'm gonna tell you it's much cheaper to eat with a club

737
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,920
 than eating out every day.

738
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,960
 But it's not gonna be,

739
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,120
 I'm gonna eat this meal with a club about that meal.

740
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,560
 It's either you're gonna eat with a club the whole time

741
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,320
 or you're not just reciprocating our records.

742
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,640
 Yeah, question?

743
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,720
 (audience member speaking off mic)

744
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,800
 (audience member speaking off mic)

745
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,560
 - So we're still figuring out the cost.

746
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,240
 So he's asking if he takes option number two,

747
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,720
 what would the cost be?

748
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,480
 So until we know how much the flights are,

749
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,080
 we really can't get specific costs.

750
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,400
 Right now we're saying that the most it should be 14.50

751
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,880
 and then of course that will come down from there.

752
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,960
 And then I think, do you have a question about tickets?

753
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,320
 How do you get a ticket?

754
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,160
 So the tickets right now are already available.

755
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,840
 If you saw on the link,

756
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,000
 there was an option to buy your Gillette ticket

757
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,880
 and the price was 232.

758
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,480
 So that's to get a ticket to enter,

759
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,680
 can't be sponsored.

760
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,000
 That's to get a ticket to enter into Gillette.

761
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,720
 So the cost per person, it's 225,

762
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,480
 but with our link that the church wants us to use,

763
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,520
 it's 232 with fees.

764
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,600
 So that's what you'll pay on that, the 232.

765
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,080
 And that will, that will be your down payment

766
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,400
 and we will reserve a ticket for you to go to Gillette.

767
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,920
 And then after that, we're saying,

768
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,680
 please have that in by December 31

769
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,320
 and then we'll know for sure who all's coming.

770
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,400
 'Cause by the end of this year,

771
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
 we really need to plan specifics and logistics.

772
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,440
 So we're asking you to decide by the end of this year,

773
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,560
 December 31, whether you're coming or not,

774
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,120
 and if you are, it's the 232 per person.

775
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,520
 And that means that you pay to the club

776
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,280
 because we'll be buying tickets.

777
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:14,120
 - If we have, so there are RB sites on property for us,

778
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,880
 off the property, 'cause I was just waiting to say,

779
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,320
 I know like even for Union,

780
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,960
 the RBs were completely separate

781
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,760
 from where the club was staying.

782
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,760
 But if you do have the RB as an option,

783
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,000
 you are staying in an army,

784
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,080
 and you're not with the club on site.

785
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,580
 Okay, so, you know, I think so.

786
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:38,240
 - So if you have an RV, so what we found out so far,

787
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,760
 Gillette does not have RVs on their campgrounds,

788
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,640
 but right across the street, there's an RV park.

789
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,840
 So yes, if the parents want to stay in the army

790
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,800
 and the kids sit with us, they can still be part of the club.

791
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,120
 You can be walking on to the side or whatnot.

792
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,040
 If your child is with you in the army, then yes,

793
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,880
 they're with you.

794
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,600
 But again, they can still be part of the club for meals,

795
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,280
 and going around with the activities

796
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,520
 as parents are still giving their hours.

797
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,960
 It's just a responsibility,

798
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,000
 lives with the parents, coming in and going off site.

799
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,080
 - Yes.

800
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,600
 So the country is now world-conversary to our--

801
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,280
 (audience member speaking off mic)

802
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,400
 Question about adventure siblings.

803
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,400
 So if you have a Pathfinder in Forest Bank Club this year,

804
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,480
 as a Pathfinder that's inducted into the club, yes.

805
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,060
 Your family can come, your adventures can come.

806
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,560
 Now remember, this is a Pathfinder campground,

807
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,960
 so there's not really activities for adventures,

808
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,280
 but as a family, we'll be able to find some things

809
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,560
 that you can do when it is going to a lake

810
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,760
 or going to different areas.

811
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,800
 You will need a Pathfinder van is what they have.

812
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,640
 So a lot of the activities, you probably won't be able to do

813
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,680
 because adventures won't have that band,

814
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,160
 but the kids will still have fun, no matter what.

815
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,560
 My little one just tagged a lot of mine.

816
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,880
 I got my mom to take care of the blue one

817
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,400
 when I was running around with the older kids,

818
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,720
 but it does help to have someone

819
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,560
 that can take care of adventures, little adventures,

820
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,720
 when you're going with your kids to do their activities.

821
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,240
 So yes, and there is a price,

822
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,520
 they see the prices, and you know we sent that down.

823
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,680
 (mumbles)

824
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,440
 There's different prices for the younger kids.

825
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,340
 So if they're aged nine to 12,

826
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:33,400
 oh that's a two, three, two, and they're older.

827
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,560
 So if they're ages four through eight,

828
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,960
 they'll be charged 125,

829
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,400
 and this is the age that they will be

830
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,440
 on the first day of the campground.

831
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,360
 So even if they're younger, when they are about

832
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,080
 a month before, they will charge us their birth date

833
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,360
 as to how old they are.

834
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,440
 So a child that's 48 is 125, and then they'll add

835
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,880
 three percent of that, and if they're a baby,

836
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,440
 ages three and younger, they're free.

837
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,640
 So it is the ticket holder stage on August 5, 2021.

838
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,140
 Those are the prices for the younger kids.

839
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,300
 (mumbles)

840
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,380
 Yes, you can, you can go ahead and purchase your ticket now.

841
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,140
 Single parents have already purchased their tickets,

842
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,300
 and you know what we'll say is if you're planning

843
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,000
 to go to the club and ride hopefully together on a plane,

844
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,820
 that when you purchase your ticket,

845
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,980
 we'll send you an email and we'll call you

846
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,180
 and ask for each person's name that's going

847
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,780
 as it is on your driver's license,

848
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,060
 or as it is legally, and we'll ask for your birthday,

849
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,660
 'cause these are the things that the airlines

850
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,260
 is gonna be asking us.

851
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,340
 So if we count on some tickets, which we will,

852
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,140
 we will put in those people that we have

853
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,580
 their information for, and you know, once an airline

854
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,420
 sees that a bunch of people are buying tickets,

855
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,340
 they're gonna start raising their prices.

856
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,460
 So we'll be constantly texting and rudely,

857
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,380
 okay, this is the price now, okay, this is the price now,

858
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,260
 and you can send your payments in,

859
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,980
 and we'll go ahead and purchase.

860
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,700
 Or we'll say, go ahead and buy it yourself if you want.

861
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,500
 This is the flight we're trying to grab,

862
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,340
 grab the tickets yourself, that's totally up to you.

863
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,260
 We're gonna try and get a little discount

864
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,220
 between it as a group, and we have been able

865
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,660
 to do that in the past, I don't know how it is this year

866
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,620
 when they find out thousands of people

867
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,660
 are fighting for Florida to go to.

868
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,900
 (audience member speaking off mic)

869
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,060
 (audience member speaking off mic)

870
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:41,660
 So they already know what we call it,

871
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,980
 and ask about the event, if you have discount

872
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,300
 for non-profit, and they say, we already know.

873
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,580
 (laughs)

874
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,980
 Yes, and she's right, they probably have already been told,

875
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,140
 but we'll see for sure as we get closer,

876
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,740
 and see the prices.

877
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,620
 So even for hotels now, hotels that are 40 miles away or so,

878
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,740
 they're going for $500 a night.

879
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:09,740
 So Gillette's very, what do you say, business savvy,

880
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:13,300
 who are doing a monopoly on the hotels, it's not cheap.

881
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,580
 I know some of our people have gotten hotels,

882
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,380
 they reserved those suits, they became available,

883
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,100
 and got a good price on them.

884
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,460
 Now, they're charging a lot.

885
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,300
 So several thousands of dollars to stay

886
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,540
 the whole week at a hotel, like Washington,

887
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,220
 and that's 40 miles away.

888
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,340
 Some people have grabbed some Airbnb's,

889
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,900
 I believe some families have grabbed an Airbnb,

890
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,940
 where six families can stay there,

891
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,500
 and that was a decent price, which just loaded up.

892
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,700
 But remember, everybody from around the world

893
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,300
 is zooming into this, every Pathfinder club

894
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,300
 is zooming into this area, and Gillette's aware of it.

895
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,140
 - Cheryl, I have a question.

896
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,140
 How long has it been for active demand for?

897
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,660
 - How long, what's the duration?

898
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,020
 - Okay, August 5, 2011.

899
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,980
 It's perfect.

900
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,980
 I was like, you were just sitting here, I'm gonna get one.

901
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,220
 (laughing)

902
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,660
 - Can you share it? - Yes.

903
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,220
 - Usually, usually it's schools,

904
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,540
 I don't know, like, schools.

905
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,860
 So, to flee, to wear, I mean,

906
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,900
 to have a way, where, you know,

907
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,100
 - Yes, I'm sure there are some.

908
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,780
 - I have a filet in here, totally excused, but no,

909
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,700
 my son said I have a filet in here too.

910
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,460
 - Yeah, I've never heard of that.

911
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:33,340
 - So, there is, there's a letter that AAT will give us.

912
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,980
 I don't know if it's ready or not yet,

913
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,460
 because it's a year away, it's a year away.

914
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,740
 But there's a letter that will give to your schools.

915
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,740
 I know Fleece and FLA and Poor City,

916
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,540
 the admin schools around here will work with the kids,

917
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,900
 and sometimes they'll just excuse the assignments,

918
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,260
 sometimes they'll say, we'll give them the extra fee

919
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,900
 to finish the assignments.

920
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,900
 Public schools, not so much.

921
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,620
 When we give them the letters to the public schools,

922
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,660
 they're like, oh, this is great,

923
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,460
 it's nice, but they're not excused.

924
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,340
 So, you know, again, it's the first week of school,

925
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,860
 they may only miss a couple days,

926
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,620
 they may miss more, it depends on what school they're going to.

927
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,860
 But you will have a letter that explains

928
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,460
 where your child is and what your child is doing.

929
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,460
 Good question.

930
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,580
 Anything else?

931
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,340
 So, Gillette seems to be the big thing

932
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,900
 that everyone's thinking about,

933
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,020
 and it is something you should be thinking about now,

934
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,500
 because before you know it, December 31st is here,

935
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,140
 and those payments are due.

936
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,740
 And it's a lot, especially if your whole family's going,

937
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,060
 that's going to cost quite a bit.

938
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,100
 And so we're doing fundraisers.

939
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,180
 Our first fundraiser, we have a fundraising committee

940
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,900
 that's trying to get activities for the kids to earn.

941
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,100
 The first one is September the 3,

942
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,940
 and that is a weekend holiday,

943
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,020
 but it was already announced in church today,

944
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,700
 we're doing a car wash.

945
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,900
 And the car wash is going to be outside the church,

946
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,700
 and we're going to try and grab as many people,

947
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,740
 we're going to try and tell the church,

948
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,540
 "Come on in, get your car washed."

949
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,100
 And we're going to do it as donations.

950
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,860
 So we don't tell the need to pay us this amount of money,

951
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,100
 because we find they need more than what you're thinking

952
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,300
 you're going to get.

953
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,980
 So they do it, they know it's for the kids,

954
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,500
 it's for a good cause, and then we take that money,

955
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,860
 and then we divide it up between the kids

956
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,340
 that have worked that car wash.

957
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,620
 We ask that one parent per child is there to help,

958
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,660
 because it's very hard for us to keep trying to catch a child,

959
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,540
 and children, when they get a chance, the young kids,

960
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,780
 it becomes a game, and then instead of washing their car,

961
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,460
 they decide to wash each other,

962
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,620
 and then it becomes a water fight and a spray fire,

963
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,780
 we just need parents there to be with their child.

964
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,100
 And that's how we'll give credit.

965
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,500
 So one parent per child,

966
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,860
 and then we will have a sign in, and sign out,

967
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,220
 we don't have to stay the whole time,

968
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,020
 we can come here for just an hour,

969
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,580
 but we will do the permit, we'll do it by minute,

970
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,140
 as to where we're there, and divide it immediately.

971
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,100
 So that's the first thing in the car wash,

972
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,020
 we will, we're planning to do a man quick,

973
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,620
 and it'll be just a nice time for the family to come,

974
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,180
 dress up, and maybe the kids will bring a date,

975
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,940
 maybe they'll sit with their class together,

976
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,740
 I don't know, whatever that would be.

977
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,700
 We don't have a date for that, we're working on that,

978
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,420
 that'll be in the warehouse.

979
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,180
 And we also have a fundraiser that's a walk-a-bye.

980
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:20,660
 So the end of October, October 29,

981
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,220
 we're going to have a walk-a-bye,

982
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,740
 and start thinking about which family members

983
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,140
 and which grandparents that you would like to

984
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,940
 have sponsor your child.

985
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,580
 So we will be at Cranes Loose Park,

986
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:36,340
 or the one mile circle there at Oscemont Mall.

987
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,420
 So there's a nice lake when we can walk around,

988
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,060
 each time the kid walks around, gets a mile,

989
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:45,500
 they'll get their sponsors ahead of time.

990
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,660
 So for example, I told this last week,

991
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:52,260
 my kids got my mom to sign up and have them give them,

992
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,700
 have her give their $20 for each mile.

993
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,940
 So my mom's thinking, yeah, a couple miles

994
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,380
 for each of them, no big deal.

995
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,020
 Well they each bought a lot of miles,

996
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,940
 and at the end I think she paid a couple hundred dollars,

997
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,580
 and she just wasn't expecting that.

998
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,100
 But that's good, grandparents don't mind those things.

999
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,620
 Again, they can get sponsors,

1000
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,940
 the kids will also sponsor each other,

1001
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,100
 so they like to fill up their sheet,

1002
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,620
 and they'll have each other's names on there,

1003
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,780
 all sponsored one cent per mile.

1004
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,940
 One cent per mile, and so it looks like they have

1005
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,860
 a lot of sponsors, but it's them sponsoring each other,

1006
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:23,300
 that's fine, every penny counts.

1007
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,580
 But again, think of all the different people you know,

1008
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,060
 it's a great way to get sponsors,

1009
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,420
 and parents, you can do it too.

1010
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,780
 You can get sponsored, and talk to your own siblings,

1011
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,820
 and your, talk to your growers.

1012
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,180
 Hey, I'm walking, I'm gonna be walking five to 10 miles

1013
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,580
 from all the spots you need,

1014
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,180
 and you'll get some money raised that way,

1015
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,580
 really good way, and the kids that are not afraid

1016
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:48,220
 to go and eat in church dinners, and ask,

1017
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,420
 they're gonna get all the sponsors,

1018
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,660
 they may get at least half of their trip covered.

1019
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:56,400
 Really depends on how these kids want to raise funds.

1020
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,260
 I know some kids already raised funds during the summer,

1021
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,060
 they were walking neighbor's dogs,

1022
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,220
 they were power washing,

1023
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,900
 and there's just different ways for kids

1024
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,500
 to get raised money for this event.

1025
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,060
 Any other questions?

1026
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:19,260
 Well, before Gillette, we have a fall camp out,

1027
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,220
 that's October 13th through 15th.

1028
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,700
 At this point, we think it's gonna be finally retrieved,

1029
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,580
 we've been calling back and forth,

1030
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,220
 it's available, we just happen to give them a deposit,

1031
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,940
 'cause we don't know how much they want to get,

1032
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,100
 but October 13th through 15th,

1033
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,700
 club camp out in the fall,

1034
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,620
 there's a little to the room we hope,

1035
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,580
 and we'll just enjoy our time together.

1036
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,500
 They'll learn camping skills,

1037
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,060
 they'll learn first aid skills,

1038
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,740
 they'll learn nature skills, and fire funding.

1039
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,700
 It'll just be a fun time to camp together,

1040
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,540
 to group with parents,

1041
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,140
 and you're welcome as long as you finish

1042
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,860
 your story with volunteers,

1043
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,020
 you're welcome to come and stay in the room with the kids

1044
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,340
 and be a part of the camp.

1045
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,900
 Of course, we'll ask you to help.

1046
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,780
 We have a famous doofy called Night Doody,

1047
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,900
 and Night Doody is where you do a shift

1048
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,940
 for about three hours in the middle of the night.

1049
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,300
 You're just guarding the camp,

1050
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,820
 you're making sure kids are where they're supposed to be,

1051
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,380
 if you see them out of their tents,

1052
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,940
 and if you need to bring them back, and whatnot.

1053
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,620
 Night Doody, we have three or four parents

1054
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,540
 doing different shifts through the night,

1055
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,420
 and of course, we have different shifts for cooking,

1056
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,060
 we have different shifts for helping with buyers,

1057
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,100
 or helping with the kitchen cleaning up,

1058
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,260
 a lot of different duties that we'll ask you

1059
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,900
 to sign up for within the camp.

1060
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,820
 So that'll be a practice for a Gillette,

1061
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,900
 that'll be a mini practice for a Gillette.

1062
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:45,420
 If any of you are very good with planning,

1063
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,340
 we have these different subcommittees,

1064
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,820
 if any of you are very good with logistics,

1065
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,300
 if you have anything to do with transporting goods,

1066
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,020
 like if you have connections,

1067
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,740
 well, if you have connections to flights,

1068
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,940
 airplane flights, please let us know,

1069
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,860
 if you have connections to trucks,

1070
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,220
 transporting goods out for here to Wyoming, let us know,

1071
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:11,780
 if you have any connections with foods,

1072
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,980
 again, anything that you have connections with,

1073
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,980
 T-shirts, making T-shirts, let us know, yes, Ms. Bette.

1074
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:27,020
 Were you volunteering, or were you having a question?

1075
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,220
 - We have connections with,

1076
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,900
 I have connections with T-shirts and,

1077
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:43,780
 thank you, so I can help with the,

1078
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,940
 I could contact some sales department

1079
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,260
 to see if they can do charter for us,

1080
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,180
 that's been a coming for,

1081
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,900
 since we are a nonprofit organization,

1082
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,460
 maybe they can help us out,

1083
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,300
 so I will give you a show.

1084
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,220
 - Sounds good, yes, please do.

1085
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,380
 If you have connections to, especially flights,

1086
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,260
 transporting things out to Wyoming,

1087
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,860
 like you said, T-shirts, food,

1088
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,780
 any discounts we can get for kids, the food,

1089
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:17,220
 we are thinking that since we have 250 kids,

1090
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,380
 maybe about 200 of those kids will go,

1091
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,940
 and if each kid only takes two people from their family,

1092
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,580
 that's already 600 people,

1093
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,780
 we're not talking about the 40 staff members

1094
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,100
 that will be going,

1095
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,500
 so we think we're gonna be between 500, 600 people minimum,

1096
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,620
 traveling out there,

1097
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,940
 and I already let the conference know that,

1098
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,620
 and the conference director, he was like,

1099
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,620
 "Whew, that's a mini city,"

1100
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,820
 and I said, "Well, I think it is,"

1101
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,660
 and he said, "You know what,

1102
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,260
 "that's bigger than most of the conferences

1103
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,740
 "that are going out there,"

1104
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,060
 and I said, "It is?"

1105
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,820
 He goes, "Yes, that alone will be bigger

1106
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,060
 "than a lot of the conferences

1107
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:56,540
 "for these other states and countries that are going."

1108
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,180
 So we'll have a pretty large area.

1109
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:04,220
 He did tell us that our campsite is going to be,

1110
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,420
 at this Florida conference,

1111
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,500
 is gonna be a one-mile walk to the stage,

1112
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,180
 so every evening for the program,

1113
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,940
 we'll be walking one mile.

1114
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,500
 Remember last week, I said, "Just start walking at a time,

1115
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,780
 "get your walking shoes ready,

1116
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,460
 "and be prepared to do a lot of walking.

1117
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,420
 "Every day, you'll probably walk at least five miles easily,

1118
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:25,340
 "easily five miles, more like 10 miles,"

1119
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,700
 and at the end of the day,

1120
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,980
 if you don't have the walking shoes,

1121
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,540
 your feet are gonna hurt,

1122
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,860
 but then you gotta get up again and walk some more,

1123
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,980
 so just make sure you have the right kinds of shoes,

1124
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,100
 make sure you're semi-in shape,

1125
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,260
 or at least you can walk for several miles,

1126
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,860
 and be able to carry,

1127
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,300
 you can do a backpack or a chair,

1128
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,340
 where everybody that has a holding chair,

1129
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,180
 those come in the end,

1130
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,580
 because you can just sit them anywhere

1131
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,300
 and sit down with rest,

1132
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,820
 and the kids, they'll just sit on the ground,

1133
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,940
 so they get a little nap,

1134
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:57,100
 and they'll sit on a lot of walking, a lot of walking.

1135
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,740
 So a mile from the stage,

1136
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,100
 that happened to us 10 years ago,

1137
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,620
 and it was a money, money week also,

1138
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:11,140
 so hopefully we'll know some of the weather ahead of time,

1139
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,580
 'cause that weekend, I wish I had boots,

1140
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,100
 that weekend I wish I had boots,

1141
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,580
 so the next one I brought my boots in,

1142
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,380
 it wasn't really raining at all,

1143
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,500
 but boots are good because you're gonna be walking

1144
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,100
 on these trails and roads that,

1145
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,820
 I don't know, maybe they're gonna be paved,

1146
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,380
 and it won't be an issue,

1147
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,740
 but be prepared, we're camping,

1148
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,780
 we're, yeah, we'll be camping.

1149
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,340
 The other thing you need to be prepared for,

1150
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,580
 we talked about it last week,

1151
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,620
 is port-a-potties.

1152
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,460
 Some parents have said,

1153
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,500
 "No, can't keep port-a-potties,

1154
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,060
 "we'll not do a port-a-pottie."

1155
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,380
 And I think I said one of the tips are

1156
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,460
 to take some baby powder,

1157
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,660
 a little container baby powder,

1158
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,140
 and you walk in, hold your nose,

1159
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,460
 spray it around a little bit,

1160
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,900
 and then you're fine, right?

1161
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,740
 (laughs)

1162
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,420
 I was like, "That's fine."

1163
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,860
 And then you've got your hand sanitizer,

1164
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,940
 which you can use that in other words, but yes.

1165
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,260
 We'll be camping, you'll be using port-a-potties,

1166
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,740
 you'll be using showers,

1167
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,780
 but Gillette is a newer place,

1168
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,820
 so they are building,

1169
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:15,060
 and they're still building items and buildings for us,

1170
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,580
 so I think the shower places will be new,

1171
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,060
 and they should be nice,

1172
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,300
 and hopefully they're large,

1173
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,180
 and we'll get a lot of people in,

1174
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,020
 and we will see,

1175
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,020
 none of us know which one is about yet.

1176
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:31,620
 Okay, any other questions?

1177
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:36,260
 Okay, anywhere.

1178
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,540
 - One other quick question, so,

1179
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,420
 parents' ticket is on the side of the array,

1180
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,020
 it's a thousand's room for parents,

1181
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,700
 and then a thousand, the children, for everything.

1182
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,260
 And then the question is,

1183
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,940
 so the activities, is that if we have a ticket,

1184
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,620
 does that mean we get to do all the activities they do,

1185
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,460
 or are we just there to guard?

1186
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,780
 - All right, so the question is,

1187
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,340
 if you have a ticket,

1188
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,540
 are you able to do the activities?

1189
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,540
 So, the open is a band,

1190
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,180
 and it should be the same band for everybody,

1191
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,180
 again, this is Gillette,

1192
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,020
 I don't know what they're gonna do, but yes.

1193
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,260
 All the pathfinders will definitely have a ticket,

1194
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,380
 and parents that are helping,

1195
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,900
 you guys are gonna be signed up as parent helpers,

1196
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,660
 we're gonna call you staff,

1197
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,580
 so that hopefully you'll be able to also do

1198
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,180
 all the different activities with your child.

1199
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,540
 But it's the adventurers that won't get the same band,

1200
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,220
 'cause they'll be paying a different price.

1201
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,820
 But the ticket again is $2.32,

1202
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,500
 and that's gonna be on site,

1203
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,660
 and then we'll tell you the cause for transportation,

1204
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:51,420
 and we'll tell you the cause for food, and et cetera.

1205
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,540
 Except for meaning travel costs,

1206
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,460
 'cause even if we fly in,

1207
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,140
 most likely we won't be flying in directly to Gillette,

1208
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,860
 we might be flying into Denver,

1209
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:01,980
 and then we might be flying to take a bus,

1210
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,900
 or we might be flying to South Dakota,

1211
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,300
 and then we still need to take a bus.

1212
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,540
 So, there's some other transportation involved

1213
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:12,660
 without just counting the tickets for the air flights.

1214
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:16,980
 (audience member speaking off mic)

1215
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,940
 Okay, she's asking what activities are offered,

1216
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,740
 and are they on site or not on site?

1217
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:24,740
 Any activity you can think of,

1218
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,060
 they will probably offer it.

1219
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,660
 Yes, there'll be some on site, there'll be some off site.

1220
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,980
 So, they have, at least in Oshkosh,

1221
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:34,220
 they have buses that will roll around,

1222
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,980
 and so you would jump on a bus,

1223
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,380
 you'd have to go to the bus areas,

1224
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,860
 and then you'd have to find the right bus,

1225
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,980
 which would be going to where you wanna go,

1226
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,660
 and then you get in long lines,

1227
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,500
 and wait for the bus to take you

1228
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,540
 to whatever activity you're going to,

1229
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,700
 and then the bus will bring you back also.

1230
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,180
 So, they've got it all worked out,

1231
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,660
 their transportation is,

1232
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,580
 once you park your car, you don't need your car anymore,

1233
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,940
 unless you're going off site to your hotel.

1234
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,260
 If you're on site, your transportation is taken care of

1235
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,420
 with those bus systems.

1236
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,420
 And so, what we've learned is,

1237
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,700
 what we've learned the hard way,

1238
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,620
 we would be like, okay, go out in the morning,

1239
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,900
 come back with your lunch, and go out again.

1240
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,220
 That's just so much travel, it's a lot of wasted time,

1241
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:18,060
 so what we're doing, some of our costs will be,

1242
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,820
 we're gonna give you lunch money.

1243
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,100
 You do lunch on your own, wherever they are,

1244
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,940
 there will be vendors, there'll be other clubs,

1245
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,580
 raising money, and selling the food,

1246
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:27,780
 and we'll keep you that cost,

1247
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,860
 so that way you don't have to come all the way back to camp,

1248
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,340
 especially down at the Nell,

1249
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:35,020
 or a mile from where everything's happening,

1250
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,740
 we don't want you to walk that whole while back,

1251
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:38,260
 and then go back again.

1252
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,500
 So lunch, we're just saying, stay out,

1253
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:45,500
 get your food, and enjoy, and then we'll see you at dinner,

1254
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,980
 and then together we'll walk to the worship.

1255
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,460
 The worship's are the best worship you could ever imagine.

1256
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,340
 The kids will remember them, the rest of them,

1257
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,100
 like, they're so creative, they're so innovative,

1258
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,300
 and they bring the kids in.

1259
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:02,140
 It's really worth it to go to

1260
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,340
 one of these international events.

1261
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,700
 Worth it for the worship, for the activities,

1262
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,340
 for the bonding, for the people that they're gonna meet

1263
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,540
 all around the world, especially with the pin-tree,

1264
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:15,340
 they love to get pins from other countries,

1265
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,660
 so you can walk around, you can go to,

1266
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,580
 okay, here's the conference room,

1267
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,300
 let's say, Korea, there's a South Korean conference,

1268
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,620
 and you go over here, okay, this conference here

1269
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:28,140
 is the England conference, where you've got, you know,

1270
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,340
 all these different countries in England or Britain,

1271
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,860
 and it just really is a lot of fun.

1272
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,340
 You will meet people that you have known from the past,

1273
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,900
 whether you went to school with them,

1274
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,540
 or whether you went to a church with them,

1275
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,140
 or maybe your parents know them,

1276
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:45,900
 you will always find somebody from your past walking around.

1277
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,900
 And I say, "Walkie."

1278
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,620
 Anything else?

1279
00:57:51,620 --> 00:58:00,500
 We talked about it last week,

1280
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,220
 so we're asking about how we're shipping,

1281
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,260
 we have to load up, we're gonna put all your chairs in there,

1282
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,780
 we're gonna put your sleeping bags in there,

1283
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,140
 we're gonna put your cots,

1284
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:10,460
 we're gonna try and ship everything that we can.

1285
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,500
 And that was one of my things that I raised up

1286
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,340
 with the conference, I'm like,

1287
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,340
 "You give us two containers, that's nothing,

1288
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,940
 that's nothing with our kids, so we need more."

1289
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,260
 And they said, "Well, they have to be fair

1290
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,780
 to each of the clubs, and then they'll see what,

1291
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,420
 they'll try to work with us."

1292
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,060
 So we've already tried, and we're trying to contract

1293
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,660
 our own room, what do you call this,

1294
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,900
 set my trip to bring our things out there?

1295
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,220
 And then I asked the conference,

1296
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,820
 "We have something that could possibly do it,

1297
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:40,020
 would you like to rent space off of us?"

1298
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,100
 And they're considering that.

1299
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:45,660
 We even got better prices than they did, so.

1300
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,660
 We're working things out like that.

1301
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:52,260
 Any other questions?

1302
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,740
 - Cheryl, so all that's due right now is $232, right?

1303
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,180
 - Correct, that's all we need right now.

1304
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:01,100
 - So once we do that, you will contact us

1305
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,300
 with the ticket price, as in complimenting.

1306
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,460
 - Yes, so the $232 is the ticket.

1307
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,140
 As soon as we get those from you,

1308
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,540
 we'll reserve tickets for you in your name.

1309
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,420
 - Okay, so the flight, the flights.

1310
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,820
 - The flights, we don't know how much it'll be

1311
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,620
 until it actually comes out, yes.

1312
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:26,820
 And as soon as flights start getting up,

1313
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,420
 again, you'll be getting lots of texts,

1314
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:31,100
 we will constantly say, "Okay, this flight is available,

1315
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,420
 this flight is available, do you want us to do it?

1316
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,580
 Do you want you to do it?"

1317
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,620
 Some of our staff are saying,

1318
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,020
 "It just might be easier all around

1319
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,220
 just to tell anyone to get your own tickets."

1320
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,700
 But there will be some kids

1321
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,500
 that will not have parents there.

1322
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,740
 So we know that we will be doing some tickets.

1323
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,260
 When it comes to the younger kids,

1324
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:51,060
 we're asking probably best not to descend

1325
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,980
 the young kid by themselves for a whole week.

1326
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,380
 It might be overwhelming for them

1327
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,100
 to be doing all that walking

1328
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,220
 and offending themselves with food.

1329
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,580
 And again, they'll need the staff,

1330
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:05,180
 but the younger they are, the more I don't know what I would say,

1331
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,380
 make it a family event or at least one parent

1332
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:10,300
 and have that bonding time with your child.

1333
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,340
 And with the adventures, I think that I say that,

1334
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:15,180
 adventures need to always be what they parent.

1335
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:19,820
 So if your adventure is a helping hand this year,

1336
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,780
 which means they're fourth grade,

1337
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,060
 that means they'll be going into pathfinders next year,

1338
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,620
 we can say, "As long as you already have a pathfinder

1339
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,140
 in our club this year,

1340
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:33,660
 if you have an adventure that's going to be graduating,

1341
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:37,780
 we can let that adventure be a pre-pathfinder

1342
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,740
 because they'll be inducted into the club

1343
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,380
 the following month when we start a new club year."

1344
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:45,540
 So officially they're not going to be pathfinders,

1345
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,340
 but we're going to try and call them pre-pathfinders

1346
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,100
 and let them get a uniform, let them march for the club.

1347
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,460
 They'll still be considered the adventures in our eyes,

1348
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,500
 but we want them to be able to get a start

1349
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,780
 on learning pathfinders and getting honors

1350
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,580
 and let them go and do that.

1351
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,660
 Again, we don't know if we can register them

1352
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,100
 with the conference as pathfinders

1353
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,860
 because they're not officially inducted,

1354
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,820
 but we will call them pre-pathfinders and let them do that.

1355
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:10,980
 I don't know if that makes sense,

1356
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,940
 but we just want to include the younger kids.

1357
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:17,700
 But again, they do need to have an older kid in pathfinders.

1358
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,380
 We're not going to take the whole fourth grade

1359
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:24,060
 adventure class as pre-pathfinders.

1360
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,140
 They need to already have a pathfinder in the club.

1361
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,060
 So they're riding out of coattails

1362
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,460
 because they're older sibling.

1363
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,740
 That's already a pathfinder.

1364
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:31,900
 And we want the parents there.

1365
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,980
 So the sibling that's an adventure

1366
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,140
 will always need to be with their parents.

1367
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,220
 They will not be sent to a home or the group.

1368
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,180
 We don't know those kids.

1369
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:42,580
 They're younger and it may be hard on them.

1370
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,660
 They will need to always be with the parent.

1371
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:55,100
 I should just leave it on my phone.

1372
01:01:55,100 --> 01:02:00,100
 (audience member speaking off microphone)

1373
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,180
 - I was wondering about the food.

1374
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,700
 Yes, if we're going to eat with the club.

1375
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:08,660
 You know, the club has like 200 kids, right?

1376
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,020
 They're always going to be there

1377
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,420
 just thinking of a rich young boy.

1378
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,420
 They're going to be neighbors or anything outside.

1379
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:19,340
 - Yes, so he asked a question about the food.

1380
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,100
 How are we going to handle the food?

1381
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,060
 So like I mentioned, lunches,

1382
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:26,980
 we plan to give you money and go to the vendors for lunch.

1383
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:31,060
 For breakfast, we'll have a hearty breakfast at the club site.

1384
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,460
 You know, there'll always be protein.

1385
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,580
 There'll always be fruits.

1386
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:36,140
 There'll always be some kind of starch.

1387
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:37,500
 We'll give you a solid breakfast

1388
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,300
 so that the kids have energy to go out.

1389
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,380
 We are still figuring out logistics.

1390
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,580
 What we'll do is for the kids that have activities

1391
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,420
 that are farther away, you know,

1392
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:53,060
 we'll say, "Okay, those that are going to the beach,

1393
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,980
 "you need to come and eat at this time

1394
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,500
 "so you can get in line.

1395
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,660
 "You have to go and get in line to try and get somewhere."

1396
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,780
 And some people will leave at six in the morning

1397
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,780
 to try and get to where they need to go

1398
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,300
 so that they get there when it opens at nine.

1399
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,100
 It's just going to be a lot of logistics

1400
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,980
 and we're working that through.

1401
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:13,220
 Food lines, in the conference,

1402
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:15,940
 we are known as having some of the best food

1403
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:20,940
 and we don't just, well, we might have to.

1404
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,380
 So we try to make it a little bit more day-ish

1405
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,940
 but when we've got 200 some kids,

1406
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,540
 they might not be able to do that.

1407
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,700
 But it'll be healthy.

1408
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,980
 It'll be delicious meals

1409
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:36,260
 and filling for breakfast and dinners.

1410
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,900
 And like I said, lunches will send you

1411
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,740
 to go to different vendors.

1412
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:42,060
 And there are lots of different vendors

1413
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:45,060
 from all different clubs.

1414
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:48,380
 I know that some of our staff want to do vending also

1415
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,260
 because as a vendor, you can make thousands

1416
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,940
 and thousands of dollars

1417
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:55,180
 but we would need parent help to be cooking

1418
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,500
 and that's just a lot of work.

1419
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,300
 So we're thinking about it,

1420
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,740
 whether we will do vending or not.

1421
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:03,420
 And then if we do vending,

1422
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,500
 we would rely on them all to take a four-hour shift

1423
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:10,860
 and cook and serve and yeah, it's a lot of work.

1424
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:11,700
 Let's see.

1425
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,420
 Good questions.

1426
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:17,580
 (audience chattering)

1427
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:28,700
 She asked about food coming and snacks and things like that.

1428
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,900
 Yes, we will be sending that with the kids.

1429
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:40,460
 We could hop into that.

1430
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:43,140
 Maybe just like a convenience place

1431
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,340
 to sell things and not cook.

1432
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,740
 Hmm, that's not a bad idea.

1433
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:52,980
 We'll have to see, yeah, we'll see if they do.

1434
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,820
 Right.

1435
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:59,660
 So I know that the conference is being sponsored,

1436
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:02,460
 I can't remember, I mean the Gillette's being sponsored

1437
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,700
 by one of the, it's either Pepsi products or Coca-Cola.

1438
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,380
 So it's either Pepsi or Coca-Cola that's sponsored them

1439
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:11,300
 and they have an anopathy.

1440
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,940
 You can't serve, if it's Pepsi,

1441
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:16,940
 you're not allowed to serve any Coca-Cola products.

1442
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:19,340
 And that's, I don't know all the vendors

1443
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,660
 that they have got sponsors for,

1444
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,820
 but I know those are some of the rules.

1445
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,820
 So I'll point out that.

1446
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:31,820
 Anything else?

1447
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,340
 All right.

1448
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,340
 You can go now.

1449
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,140
 I guess we're done with this here question and answers.

1450
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,260
 If there's anything that hasn't been answered,

1451
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:44,140
 feel free to come ask me and every club meeting,

1452
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:48,260
 I'll be here after we send the kids off,

1453
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,980
 I'll answer any questions for you

1454
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,860
 and then the kids get out at 6.30.

1455
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,900
 Something we didn't ask earlier, at 6.30,

1456
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,580
 after 6.30, they'll get dismissed.

1457
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,780
 If your kid is interested in drums,

1458
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,940
 we will start here at 6.45

1459
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,300
 and do a drum corps interest meeting.

1460
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,180
 So you can find out about the drum corps,

1461
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,100
 the kids can see what the different drums are

1462
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,220
 that they can possibly play.

1463
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,460
 But that will be happening this evening at 6.45.

1464
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,460
 That will last for about an hour or so.

1465
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:22,460
 So drum corps, they meet on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.

1466
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:27,140
 Sundays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.

1467
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:30,460
 It's a commitment, but you need to do a lot of repetition

1468
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,620
 in order to be good at drums.

1469
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:35,020
 That's a great experience.

1470
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,900
 Have your kids join, have your kids join drums.

1471
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:39,540
 There's also a drill.

1472
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,500
 We'll start that in a little while.

1473
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,540
 Drill, they can be on the drill team.

1474
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,260
 We can also have an adult drill team.

1475
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,020
 So many of you are good at drilling

1476
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,940
 or want to try and drill.

1477
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:49,780
 We welcomed that.

1478
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,020
 Our adult team last year pulled it together

1479
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:54,300
 in a couple weeks and scored first place.

1480
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:58,460
 So we expect this to be a habit

1481
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,620
 that the adults call this score first.

1482
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:03,380
 And then we also have PDE,

1483
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,260
 which is the Pathway to Biology experience.

1484
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,660
 That's viable.
